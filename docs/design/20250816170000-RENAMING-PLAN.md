# Renaming Plan: from jarkdown to jarkdown

**Date:** 2025-08-16
**Author:** Gemini

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the comprehensive plan to rename the project from `jarkdown` to `jarkdown`. The new name is a portmanteau of "Jira" and "Markdown," which more accurately reflects the tool's core functionality.

This plan is designed to be executed systematically to ensure that all references to the old name are updated, including package metadata, source code, documentation, and user-facing commands. No code will be modified during the planning phase.

## 2. High-Level Action Plan

The renaming process will be executed in the following phases:

1.  **Directory and File Renaming:** The package source directory and other artifacts will be renamed.
2.  **Configuration Updates:** All project configuration files (`pyproject.toml`, etc.) will be updated to reflect the new name.
3.  **Source Code Updates:** All internal source code references, imports, and class names will be changed.
4.  **Documentation Updates:** All user and developer documentation will be updated to use the new name.
5.  **Verification:** The project will be installed and tested to ensure the renaming was successful and the tool remains fully functional.

## 3. Detailed Step-by-Step Plan

### Phase 1: Directory and File Renaming

The following directory and file structure changes are required.

1.  **Rename the main package directory:**
    *   **From:** `src/jarkdown/`
    *   **To:** `src/jarkdown/`

2.  **Rename the main executable script module:**
    *   **From:** `src/jarkdown/jarkdown.py`
    *   **To:** `src/jarkdown/jarkdown.py`

3.  **Clean up old build artifacts (to be done after changes):**
    *   The `jarkdown.egg-info` and `src/jarkdown.egg-info` directories will be removed during the build cleanup process.

### Phase 2: Configuration Updates

The following files need to be modified to update the project's identity.

1.  **`pyproject.toml`:**
    *   Update the project name: `name = "jarkdown"` -> `name = "jarkdown"`
    *   Update the script entry point: `jarkdown = "..."` -> `jarkdown = "jarkdown.jarkdown:main"`
    *   Update the package discovery to find the new directory name.

2.  **`.github/workflows/ci.yml`:**
    *   Review and update any steps that might reference the old package name or directories.

3.  **`.pre-commit-config.yaml`:**
    *   Ensure that the hooks and configurations do not rely on the old name.

### Phase 3: Source Code Updates

A global search-and-replace will be performed for `jarkdown` and `Jarkdown`.

1.  **Update Imports:**
    *   All relative imports within the package (e.g., in `jarkdown.py`) will need to be checked to ensure they still point to the correct modules.

2.  **Update Exception Names:**
    *   The custom exception classes in `exceptions.py` should be renamed for consistency.
    *   **Example:** `JarkdownError` -> `JarkdownError`

3.  **Update Class and Function Names (if applicable):**
    *   Review class names and function names for any instances of the old name.

### Phase 4: Documentation Updates

All documentation must be updated to reflect the new name `jarkdown`.

1.  **`README.md`:**
    *   Update the title, installation instructions, and all usage examples.

2.  **`CHANGELOG.md`:**
    *   Update any references to the old name.

3.  **All files in `docs/`:**
    *   Perform a project-wide find-and-replace for `jarkdown`.
    *   Pay special attention to `docs/source/conf.py` (project name) and all `.md` and `.rst` files containing usage examples or descriptions.

### Phase 5: Verification

After all changes have been applied, the following steps will be taken to verify the success of the renaming.

1.  **Clean the build environment:**
    *   Remove `dist/`, `build/`, and any `.egg-info` directories.

2.  **Run the test suite:**
    *   Execute `pytest` to ensure all tests pass. The tests themselves may need to be updated to reflect new names (e.g., for exceptions).

3.  **Perform a local installation:**
    *   Run `pip install .[dev]` to install the newly named package.

4.  **Test the installed command:**
    *   From a different directory, run `jarkdown --help`. The command should execute successfully and display the help message.
    *   Run a full test command (e.g., `jarkdown PROJ-123`) against a mock server or with appropriate credentials to ensure end-to-end functionality.

## 4. Conclusion

This plan provides a clear and comprehensive roadmap for renaming the project. By following these steps, we can ensure a smooth transition to the new name `jarkdown` while maintaining the tool's functionality and quality.
