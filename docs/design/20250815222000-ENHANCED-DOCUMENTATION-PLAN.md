# Plan: Enhanced User Documentation with Sphinx and Read the Docs

**Date:** 2025-08-15
**Author:** Gemini

## 1. Executive Summary

To significantly improve the user experience and project professionalism, this plan outlines the creation of a comprehensive, beautiful, and easy-to-navigate documentation website.

The current `README.md` is adequate for developers but lacks the depth and polish required for a broader user base. A dedicated documentation site will provide a central, trusted source of information for installation, usage, configuration, and contribution.

We will use **Sphinx** as the documentation generator and host the final site on **Read the Docs**, which is the standard for the Python community and integrates seamlessly with GitHub.

## 2. Key Objectives

1.  **Improve User Onboarding:** Provide a clear, step-by-step "Getting Started" guide for both technical and non-technical users.
2.  **Create Comprehensive Guides:** Detail all features, options, and configuration with practical examples.
3.  **Automate API Documentation:** Generate API reference documentation directly from the code's docstrings to ensure it's always up-to-date.
4.  **Enhance Professionalism:** Present the project with a clean, modern, and polished documentation site that inspires confidence.
5.  **Centralize Information:** Create a single source of truth for all project-related information, including contributing guidelines and architectural overviews.

## 3. Implementation Plan

This plan is broken down into four phases: Setup, Content Creation, Automation, and Deployment.

### Phase 1: Project Setup & Configuration

This phase lays the foundation for the documentation.

1.  **Initialize Sphinx:**
    *   Create a new `docs/source` directory to hold the documentation source files.
    *   Run `sphinx-quickstart` to generate the initial structure and `conf.py` file.
2.  **Select and Configure a Modern Theme:**
    *   Choose a visually appealing and mobile-friendly theme. The **Furo** theme is highly recommended for its clean, modern aesthetic.
    *   Install the theme via a new `docs/requirements.txt` file.
    *   Configure `docs/source/conf.py` to use the new theme and set project details (project name, author, copyright).
3.  **Enable Necessary Sphinx Extensions:**
    *   In `conf.py`, enable the following extensions:
        *   `sphinx.ext.autodoc`: To pull in documentation from docstrings.
        *   `sphinx.ext.napoleon`: To support Google-style docstrings.
        *   `sphinx.ext.viewcode`: To add links to the source code from the docs.
        *   `myst_parser`: To allow writing documentation in Markdown (`.md`) in addition to reStructuredText (`.rst`).

### Phase 2: Content Creation

This phase involves writing the core documentation content. All files will be created within the `docs/source/` directory.

1.  **`index.rst` (The Landing Page):**
    *   Write a compelling project introduction.
    *   Include key features and a high-level overview.
    *   Create a `toctree` (table of contents) to structure the entire documentation site.
2.  **`installation.md`:**
    *   Provide clear, copy-paste-friendly installation instructions.
    *   Include sections for both `pip install jarkdown` (once published) and installing from source.
    *   Detail the environment variable setup with clear instructions on how to get a Jira API token.
3.  **`usage.md` (User Guide):**
    *   Create a "Quickstart" section showing the most common command.
    *   Detail all command-line arguments (`--output`, `--verbose`) with examples for each.
    *   Explain the output structure (the created folder, the markdown file, and attachments).
4.  **`api_reference.rst` (For Developers):**
    *   This file will use `autodoc` directives to automatically generate documentation for the main classes:
        *   `JiraApiClient`
        *   `AttachmentHandler`
        *   `MarkdownConverter`
    *   This requires ensuring the in-code docstrings are clean and comprehensive.
5.  **`contributing.md`:**
    *   Move the content from the root `CONTRIBUTING.md` here.
    *   **Crucially, update the development setup instructions to use `pip install .[dev]` instead of the incorrect `requirements.txt` command.**
6.  **`architecture.md` (Optional but Recommended):**
    *   Write a brief overview of the project's architecture, explaining how the different components (`JiraApiClient`, `AttachmentHandler`, etc.) work together. This is highly valuable for new contributors.

### Phase 3: Build Automation & Integration

This phase ensures the documentation stays up-to-date automatically.

1.  **Create a `.readthedocs.yaml` file:**
    *   Add this file to the project root.
    *   This file will configure the Read the Docs build server.
    *   It will specify:
        *   The Python version to use.
        *   The path to the Sphinx configuration (`docs/source/conf.py`).
        *   The path to the documentation-specific requirements file (`docs/requirements.txt`).
2.  **Update the CI Workflow (`ci.yml`):**
    *   Add a new job to the GitHub Actions workflow that builds the documentation on every push to `main`.
    *   This ensures that any changes that break the documentation build are caught immediately. The command to run would be `sphinx-build -b html docs/source docs/build/html`.

### Phase 4: Deployment to Read the Docs

1.  **Create a Read the Docs Account:**
    *   Sign up for a free account on [readthedocs.org](https://readthedocs.org/).
2.  **Import the GitHub Repository:**
    *   Link the GitHub account and import the `jarkdown` repository.
3.  **Trigger the First Build:**
    *   Read the Docs will automatically detect the `.readthedocs.yaml` file and build the documentation.
4.  **Update the `README.md`:**
    *   Add a documentation badge to the top of the main `README.md` that links to the new, live documentation site.

## 4. Expected Outcome

Upon completion of this plan, the `jarkdown` project will have a professional, comprehensive, and beautiful documentation website. This will dramatically improve the experience for all users, lower the barrier for new contributors, and establish the project as a high-quality, well-maintained tool.
