# AI-Powered Development with Jarkdown ("Vibecoding")

One of the most powerful use cases for Jarkdown is to enhance and accelerate development workflows that utilize AI coding assistants like GitHub Copilot, Gemini, Claude, and others. This process, sometimes called "vibecoding," is all about providing the AI with the high-quality context it needs to generate accurate, relevant code.

## The Problem: AI Lacks Context

When you're assigned a task in Jira, the ticket contains a wealth of information:
- A detailed description of the feature or bug.
- Acceptance criteria.
- Technical notes from the reporter or other developers.
- Attached files, such as mockups, diagrams, or data exports.
- Metadata like priority, labels, and affected versions.

An AI assistant has access to none of this. If you simply ask it to "create a user authentication endpoint," it will generate generic code based on its training data. This code will lack the specific business logic, error handling, and other nuances required by your project, which are often detailed in the Jira ticket.

## The Solution: Jarkdown Provides the "Vibe"

Jarkdown bridges this context gap. By running a single command (`jarkdown PROJ-123`), you get a clean, self-contained Markdown file that includes:
- The full issue description, converted to readable Markdown.
- A clear metadata section.
- A list of all attachments, which are downloaded to a local folder.

This exported file is the perfect context to include in a prompt for your AI assistant.

## Example Workflow

1.  **Export the Jira Issue:**
    Before you start coding, run Jarkdown on your assigned ticket.
    ```bash
    jarkdown PROJ-456
    ```
    This creates a `PROJ-456/` directory with the Markdown file and all attachments.

2.  **Prepare Your Prompt:**
    Open the `PROJ-456.md` file and copy its contents. Now, craft a prompt for your AI assistant.

    **Bad Prompt (without context):**
    > "Write a Python function to process a user data CSV and upload it to S3."

    **Good Prompt (with Jarkdown context):**
    > "Based on the following Jira ticket, write a Python function that accomplishes the task. Pay close attention to the required CSV format in the attachments and the error handling specified in the description.
    >
    > ---
    >
    > **Title:** [PROJ-456] Implement User Data CSV Import
    >
    > **Metadata:**
    > - **Type:** Story
    > - **Status:** To Do
    > - **Priority:** High
    >
    > **Description:**
    > We need a script to process the attached `user_data.csv`. The script should validate each row...
    >
    > **Attachments:**
    > - `user_data.csv`
    > - `processing_flow.png`
    >
    > ---"

3.  **Iterate with the AI:**
    The AI now has the same context you do. It understands the "vibe" of the ticket. Its generated code will be far more accurate, adhering to the specific requirements of the task. You can now iterate with the AI on the generated code, asking for refinements based on the context you both share.

By integrating Jarkdown into your development process, you can significantly reduce the time it takes to get useful, relevant code from AI assistants, allowing you to focus on more complex architectural and problem-solving tasks.
